//	"Strategy" comes from the design pattern of the name ("Design patterns" (gang of 4))
//	Filters will be used to decide on whether to dump a particular object based on such
//		things as
//			Different sensitivities to the completeness/correctness of the object (especially
//			when feeding the parser).
//			User-defined properties, such as which lexical items are to be
//				part of a particular dictionary.
