{
	/// <summary>
	/// This class implements the DotNet Acessibility interface by wrapping the COM IAccessible interface
	/// implemented by the root box.
	/// It is uncomfortably similar to ViewsInterfaces.AccessibleObjectFromIAccessible, but was developed
	/// independently since we (JohnT and Dan) didn't find AccessibleObjectFromIAccessible until later.
	/// The most important difference is that this version stores the root site as well as its
	/// AccessibleRootObject. This handles the problem that DotNet apparently only asks any one object
	/// to CreateAccessibilityInstance() once; then it caches the result. So if we return null,
	/// or make an AccessibleObjectFromIAccessible that has a null IAccessible, it will never work later
	/// when the root box has been made and the IAccessible is available. (In fact, it crashes, because
	/// AccessibleObjectFromIAccessible is not coded to handle a null IAccessible.)
	/// This class, whenever it needs the IAccessble, checks whether it is null. If so, it checks the
	/// root site to see whether it is now possible to get a proper AccessibleRootObject, and if so starts
	/// using it. If not, it answers something safe and neutral.
	///
	/// It's possible that we could refactor to share some code between the two classes, for example,
	/// give AccessibleObjectFromIAccessible a virtual method to get the IAccessible (and always use it),
	/// then this class might only need to override that method to try getting the IAcessible from the
	/// rootsite if it doesn't already have one. However, we'd have to merge into AccessibleObjectFromIAccessible
	/// all the code from here that handles IAccessible being null.
	///
	/// Another possible way to remove the duplication is just to delete AccessibleObjectFromIAccessible,
	/// since it doesn't seem to be used and was possibly just an unsuccessful attempt at what this class
	/// seems to do successfully.
