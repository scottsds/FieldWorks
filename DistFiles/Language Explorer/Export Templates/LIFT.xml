Export the lexicon in the Lexicon Interchange FormaT (LIFT) version 0.13.  A LIFT export consists of a folder with several files and folders inside of it.  Although there is a single "LIFT file", a lift export is not complete without the whole folder and the other files that are included.  See http://code.google.com/p/lift-standard for more information about LIFT. Exports all fields of all entries.</FxtDocumentDescription>
